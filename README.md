🔹 Phase 1: Improve FPS Basics (Player Movement & Camera)
✅ [Task 1] Implement Free-Look Mouse Camera (FPS Controls)

Right now, the camera is static. We need mouse-based aiming.
Use SetMouseMode(MOUSE_DISABLED) for free-look.
✔ What to do?

Modify main.cpp → Replace camera controls with FPS-style movement.
Use GetMouseDelta() to change the camera’s view direction.
📌 Resources:

Raylib Camera Example
🔹 Phase 2: Improve AI & Shooting
✅ [Task 2] AI Pathfinding & Behavior

AI should not just walk straight; it should patrol and chase.
Implement randomized patrol routes.
Add basic obstacle avoidance (simple raycasting).
✔ What to do?

Modify enemy.cpp to add patrol behavior.
Use distance checks to detect the player and chase.
✅ [Task 3] Bullet Physics & Collision

Right now, bullets are just spheres moving straight.
Add raycasting for instant hit detection.
✔ What to do?

Modify bullet.cpp → Implement Raylib’s CheckCollisionRaySphere().
📌 Resources:

Raylib Collision Detection
🔹 Phase 3: Build a Cool 3D Map
✅ [Task 4] Design a Simple 3D Environment (Basic Map)

Right now, it's just a flat plane.
Add walls, crates, doors, and obstacles.
Use Raylib’s DrawCube() to create a blocky CS:GO-style map.
✔ What to do?

Modify game.cpp → Add walls, cover objects, and stairs.
Store level layout in an array (so it can be loaded easily).
📌 Resources:

Raylib 3D Objects
✅ [Task 5] Textures & Materials

Right now, objects are solid colors.
Apply textures to walls and the ground.
✔ What to do?

Modify game.cpp → Use LoadTexture() and DrawCubeTexture().
Find CS:GO-like textures online and apply them.
📌 Resources:

Raylib Texturing
🔹 Phase 4: Advanced AI & Game Mechanics
✅ [Task 6] AI Shooting & Cover System

AI should shoot back at the player.
AI should hide behind cover if under attack.
✔ What to do?

Modify enemy.cpp → Add AI decision-making.
Use simple cover detection.
📌 Concepts to Explore:

Finite State Machines (FSM) for AI states.
✅ [Task 7] Add Weapon Switching & Reloading

Implement multiple weapons (Pistol, Rifle, Sniper).
Add reloading mechanics.
✔ What to do?

Modify player.cpp → Add weapon switching (KEY_1, KEY_2).
📌 Concepts to Explore:

Raylib UI for Ammo HUD
🔹 Phase 5: Multiplayer & Polish
✅ [Task 8] Add Basic Multiplayer (Optional)

Implement Local Multiplayer (Split-Screen or LAN).
Use Raylib networking for simple LAN multiplayer.
✔ What to do?

Modify main.cpp → Handle multiple players.
📌 Concepts to Explore:

Networking Basics with Raylib
✅ [Task 9] Add Sound Effects & Polish

Right now, the game is silent.
Add gunshot sounds, footsteps, and enemy attack sounds.
✔ What to do?

Modify game.cpp → Use LoadSound() and PlaySound().
📌 Resources:

Raylib Audio
🎯 Final Goal
✔ Fully Playable FPS
✔ Cool 3D Map
✔ AI Enemies with Shooting & Cover
✔ Weapons, Reloading, and Sound

🚀 Timeframe to Implement Each Task
Since you're aiming for a basic but fun CS:GO-style FPS, here's a realistic breakdown of how long each feature will take.

Phase	Feature	Estimated Time
🎯 Phase 1: FPS Core Mechanics	[Task 1] FPS Mouse Look & Movement	⏳ 2-3 hours
[Task 2] AI Pathfinding & Patrol Behavior	⏳ 3-4 hours
[Task 3] Bullet Physics & Collision Detection	⏳ 2 hours
🎯 Phase 2: 3D Map & Environment	[Task 4] Create a Simple 3D Map (Walls, Cover)	⏳ 4-5 hours
[Task 5] Add Textures & Materials	⏳ 2-3 hours
🎯 Phase 3: Advanced AI & Weapons	[Task 6] AI Shooting & Cover System	⏳ 4-5 hours
[Task 7] Weapon Switching & Reloading	⏳ 3-4 hours
🎯 Phase 4: Multiplayer & Polish	[Task 8] Local Multiplayer (LAN or Split-Screen) (Optional)	⏳ 6-8 hours
[Task 9] Sound Effects & Polish	⏳ 2-3 hours
Total Estimated Time	💥 25-30 hours	
🔥 Suggested Sprint Plan (Based on Your Available Time)
⏳ If you work 3-4 hours per day, you can complete this in about a week.

🚀 3-Day Plan (MVP)
If you want a basic playable version first, focus on:

Day 1: FPS Mouse Look, Movement & AI Patrol
Day 2: Bullet Collision & Basic 3D Map
Day 3: AI Shooting & Cover Mechanics
Then expand with textures, weapon switching, and sounds in the following days.
